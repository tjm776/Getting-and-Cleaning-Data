Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

This repo contains the project for the Coursea course "Getting and Cleaning Data" from Johns Hopkins University.

Purpose:

This project is to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data
set that can be used for later analysis.

Data Source:

The data used for this project is from the site listed below.  It contains data collected from the accelerometers
on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone used by the subjects.

Script:

The run_analysis.R script is used to perform the following functions. 

1. Merge the data files to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Create descriptive activity names for the activities in the data set.
4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Create a second independent tidy data set.
6. Put the average of each variable for each activity and each subject in the tidy data.
7. Writes the tidy data set to a text file.

Additional Information:

See the CodeBook.MD file for information on the data files, variables, and any how the data was cleaned.
